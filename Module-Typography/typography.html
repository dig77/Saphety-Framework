          <h1>Typography</h1>

          <div class="sub-heading">
            system’s UI font as its primary typeface and alternative font for
            sub-headings
          </div>

          <p class="is-text">
            Text is the main way that teams visualize content and complete their
            work, so we've developed a typographic landscape that uses system
            fonts for all standard typefaces in Saphety products. This ensures
            that the UI is optimized to be highly legible, performs well, and is
            frictionless as you move between Saphety products and the rest of
            the system.
          </p>

          <p class="is-text">
            Typography creates purposeful texture. It guides users to read and
            understand the hierarchy of information. The right typographic
            treatment and the controlled usage of type styles helps manage the
            display of content, keeping it useful, simple and effective.
          </p>

          <h3>What is a system font stack?</h3>

          <p class="is-text">
            There are different types of fonts to choose from when it comes to a
            website. You pretty much have four different options:
          </p>
          <ul class="is-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Web safe fonts: </strong>Free and no download time
              required by the browser, but typically look dated and therefore
              aren’t used a lot. See a list of web safe fonts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Web fonts: </strong>Look beautiful, but require download
              by the browser. Have both free and premium options available. Adds
              to the overall page weight of your website. However, they can be
              served from cached CDN. Providers include Google, Adobe Fonts
              (TypeKit), etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Host web fonts locally: </strong>Both free and premium
              options available. Still requires download time, can take
              advantage of single HTTP/2 connection on cached CDN.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>System fonts: </strong>Free, look pretty darn good as they
              match the OS, and no download time required! They are used by
              GitHub, Bootstrap, Medium, Ghost, Booking.com (read their system
              font story), and even your WordPress dashboard. In my personal
              opinion system fonts look slightly better on macOS versus Windows.
              System fonts are nothing new. In fact, Medium has been using them
              since 2015. They feel just like your OS because they are using
              native fonts. Many of the modern operating systems choose fonts
              very wisely and all have a very sleek look and feel to them. It’s
              not like defaulting back to a web-safe font of Arial or Times New
              Roman. Trust me, nobody wants to see Times New Roman on a website.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="is-text">
            Everything you load on your pages has a cost. This cost is
            especially impactful on mobile, where every byte you require is
            impacting the load time, and the amount of bandwidth you make your
            users consume. The font must load before the content renders, so you
            need to wait for that resource loading to complete before the user
            is able to read even a single word you wrote. But Web Fonts are a
            way to provide an awesome user experience through good typography.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Enter System Fonts
          </h3>

          <p class="is-text">
            Operating Systems have great default fonts. System Fonts offer the
            great advantage of speed and performance, and a reduction of your
            web page size. But as a side effect, they make your website look
            very familiar to anyone looking at it, because they are used to see
            that same font every day on their computer or mobile device. It’s
            effectively a native font. And as it’s the system font, it’s
            guaranteed to look great.
